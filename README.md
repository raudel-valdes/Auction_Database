# Auction Base Database

For this project I was provided a set of if JSON files that contained data from eBay auctions. The data was scrapped from eBay over ten years ago and was cleaned up in order to allow parsing through the files and accessing specific data.

The purpose of the project was to design a database that would store all of the information that was contained within the JSON files in an asppropriate way.

    MORE WILL BE ADDED TO THIS SECTION IN THE FUTURE

This project was provided by Standford University CS-145 course and given to me as an assignment by my CECS-535 Intro to Databases course at the University of Louisville during my undergraduate career.
